I created a sketch of Messi shooting a ball into the goal where the user can click and drag the ball to shoot. I love watching Argentina play in the World Cup because my dad is from there so it was a fun choice. I made the skyline an abstract version of the Argentine flag with the sun, clouds, and correct rgb values for the sky. For the ball I used a bounce mechanic that reflects the velocity on wall hit and added a small gravity value as well.
